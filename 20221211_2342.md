## [DP-RAFT: A Differentially Private Recipe for Accelerated Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04486v1)

A major direction in differentially private machine learning is differentially private fine-tuning: pretraining a model on a source of "public data" and transferring the extracted features to downstream tasks. 
This is an important setting because many industry deployments fine-tune publicly available feature extractors on proprietary data for downstream tasks. 
In this paper, we use features extracted from state-of-the-art open source models to solve benchmark tasks in computer vision and natural language processing using differentially private fine-tuning. Our key insight is that by accelerating training, we can quickly drive the model parameters to regions in parameter space where the impact of noise is minimized. In doing so, we recover the same performance as non-private fine-tuning for realistic values of epsilon in [0.01, 1.0] on benchmark image classification datasets including CIFAR100.


## [XRand: Differentially Private Defense against Explanation-Guided Attacks](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04454v1)

*Truc Nguyen, Phung Lai, NhatHai Phan, My T. Thai*

Recent development in the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has helped improve trust in Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems, in which an explanation is provided together with the model prediction in response to each query. However, XAI also opens a door for adversaries to gain insights into the black-box models in MLaaS, thereby making the models more vulnerable to several attacks. For example, feature-based explanations (e.g., SHAP) could expose the top important features that a black-box model focuses on. Such disclosure has been exploited to craft effective backdoor triggers against malware classifiers. To address this trade-off, we introduce a new concept of achieving local differential privacy (LDP) in the explanations, and from that we establish a defense, called XRand, against such attacks. We show that our mechanism restricts the information that the adversary can learn about the top important features, while maintaining the faithfulness of the explanations.


## [Skellam Mixture Mechanism: a Novel Approach to Federated Learning with Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04371v1)

Deep neural networks have strong capabilities of memorizing the underlying training data, which can be a serious privacy concern. An effective solution to this problem is to train models with differential privacy, which provides rigorous privacy guarantees by injecting random noise to the gradients. This paper focuses on the scenario where sensitive data are distributed among multiple participants, who jointly train a model through federated learning (FL), using both secure multiparty computation (MPC) to ensure the confidentiality of each gradient update, and differential privacy to avoid data leakage in the resulting model. A major challenge in this setting is that common mechanisms for enforcing DP in deep learning, which inject real-valued noise, are fundamentally incompatible with MPC, which exchanges finite-field integers among the participants. Consequently, most existing DP mechanisms require rather high noise levels, leading to poor model utility. Motivated by this, we propose Skellam mixture mechanism (SMM), an approach to enforce DP on models built via FL. Compared to existing methods, SMM eliminates the assumption that the input gradients must be integer-valued, and, thus, reduces the amount of noise injected to preserve DP. Further, SMM allows tight privacy accounting due to the nice composition and sub-sampling properties of the Skellam distribution, which are key to accurate deep learning with DP. The theoretical analysis of SMM is highly non-trivial, especially considering (i) the complicated math of differentially private deep learning in general and (ii) the fact that the mixture of two Skellam distributions is rather complex, and to our knowledge, has not been studied in the DP literature. Extensive experiments on various practical settings demonstrate that SMM consistently and significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of the utility of the resulting model.


## [Differentially-Private Bayes Consistency](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04216v1)

*Olivier Bousquet, Haim Kaplan, Aryeh Kontorovich, Yishay Mansour, Shay Moran, Menachem Sadigurschi, Uri Stemmer*

We construct a universally Bayes consistent learning rule that satisfies differential privacy (DP). We first handle the setting of binary classification and then extend our rule to the more general setting of density estimation (with respect to the total variation metric). The existence of a universally consistent DP learner reveals a stark difference with the distribution-free PAC model. Indeed, in the latter DP learning is extremely limited: even one-dimensional linear classifiers are not privately learnable in this stringent model. Our result thus demonstrates that by allowing the learning rate to depend on the target distribution, one can circumvent the above-mentioned impossibility result and in fact, learn \emph{arbitrary} distributions by a single DP algorithm. As an application, we prove that any VC class can be privately learned in a semi-supervised setting with a near-optimal \emph{labeled} sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(d/\varepsilon)$ labeled examples (and with an unlabeled sample complexity that can depend on the target distribution).

## [Integer Subspace Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.00936v1)

*Prathamesh Dharangutte, Jie Gao, Ruobin Gong, Fang-Yi Yu*

We propose new differential privacy solutions for when external \emph{invariants} and \emph{integer} constraints are simultaneously enforced on the data product. These requirements arise in real world applications of private data curation, including the public release of the 2020 U.S. Decennial Census. They pose a great challenge to the production of provably private data products with adequate statistical usability. We propose \emph{integer subspace differential privacy} to rigorously articulate the privacy guarantee when data products maintain both the invariants and integer characteristics, and demonstrate the composition and post-processing properties of our proposal. To address the challenge of sampling from a potentially highly restricted discrete space, we devise a pair of unbiased additive mechanisms, the generalized Laplace and the generalized Gaussian mechanisms, by solving the Diophantine equations as defined by the constraints. The proposed mechanisms have good accuracy, with errors exhibiting sub-exponential and sub-Gaussian tail probabilities respectively. To implement our proposal, we design an MCMC algorithm and supply empirical convergence assessment using estimated upper bounds on the total variation distance via $L$-lag coupling. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal with applications to a synthetic problem with intersecting invariants, a sensitive contingency table with known margins, and the 2010 Census county-level demonstration data with mandated fixed state population totals.

## [Pre-trained Encoders in Self-Supervised Learning Improve Secure and Privacy-preserving Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03334v1)

*Hongbin Liu, Wenjie Qu, Jinyuan Jia, Neil Zhenqiang Gong*

Classifiers in supervised learning have various security and privacy issues, e.g., 1) data poisoning attacks, backdoor attacks, and adversarial examples on the security side as well as 2) inference attacks and the right to be forgotten for the training data on the privacy side. Various secure and privacy-preserving supervised learning algorithms with formal guarantees have been proposed to address these issues. However, they suffer from various limitations such as accuracy loss, small certified security guarantees, and/or inefficiency. Self-supervised learning is an emerging technique to pre-train encoders using unlabeled data. Given a pre-trained encoder as a feature extractor, supervised learning can train a simple yet accurate classifier using a small amount of labeled training data. In this work, we perform the first systematic, principled measurement study to understand whether and when a pre-trained encoder can address the limitations of secure or privacy-preserving supervised learning algorithms. Our key findings are that a pre-trained encoder substantially improves 1) both accuracy under no attacks and certified security guarantees against data poisoning and backdoor attacks of state-of-the-art secure learning algorithms (i.e., bagging and KNN), 2) certified security guarantees of randomized smoothing against adversarial examples without sacrificing its accuracy under no attacks, 3) accuracy of differentially private classifiers, and 4) accuracy and/or efficiency of exact machine unlearning.


## [Straggler-Resilient Differentially-Private Decentralized Learning](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03080v1)

*Yauhen Yakimenka, Chung-Wei Weng, Hsuan-Yin Lin, Eirik Rosnes, JÃ¶rg Kliewer*

We consider the straggler problem in decentralized learning over a logical ring while preserving user data privacy. Especially, we extend the recently proposed framework of differential privacy (DP) amplification by decentralization by Cyffers and Bellet to include overall training latency--comprising both computation and communication latency. Analytical results on both the convergence speed and the DP level are derived for both a skipping scheme (which ignores the stragglers after a timeout) and a baseline scheme that waits for each node to finish before the training continues. A trade-off between overall training latency, accuracy, and privacy, parameterized by the timeout of the skipping scheme, is identified and empirically validated for logistic regression on a real-world dataset.
